  # A note on this test...

  # This test compares the two alternative ways of deriving predictions of the 'iblm' model.

  # a) By using the 'data_beta_coeff' dataframe of corrected beta coefficients output by explain_iblm().
  #     If we multiply these coefficients by the relevant values (i.e. 1 for bias/categoricals, x for continuous)
  #     We can sum together and apply inverse link function to get the prediction glm-style.
  # b) By using the predict() function, which will use predict.iblm() method from the iblm package

  # In theory, the results should be very similar (not expect identical due to shap noise).

  # changing factors to characters... this is necessary as bug in original script handles factors incorrectly
  # changing "ClaimRate" to use "ClaimNb"... this is necessary as "ClaimNb" hardcoded in KG script and easier to modify in package script
  # changing "ClaimNb" to round to integer values. This is to avoid warnings in the test environment.
