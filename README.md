### Overview

**IBLM** implements *Interpretable Boosted Linear Models* — a hybrid modelling approach that combines the transparency of generalized linear models (GLMs) with the predictive power of gradient boosting.  

The package provides:

- Functions for fitting interpretable boosted linear models  
- Tools to analyze and visualize model results  
- Support for model comparison and diagnostics

### Installation

You can install the **released version** of IBLM from **CRAN**:

```r
install.packages("IBLM")
```

You can install the **development version** from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IFoA-ADSWP/IBLM")
```

### Example

Here’s a minimal example to train and explain an IBLM:

```r
library(IBLM)

df_list <- freMTPLmini  |>
  split_into_train_validate_test()

iblm_model <- train_iblm_xgb(
  df_list,
  response_var = "ClaimRate",
  family = "poisson"
)

ex <- explain_iblm(iblm_model, df_list$test)


```
